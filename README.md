# Bayesian-Neural-Network

Bayesian Neural Network is something that is not very implemented since already NN needs a lot of computational power, 
MCMC on NN than it's too much! But still I tryed to play a little bit in a simple example....

p.s. the main problem of this simulation is that the space of the weight is really complicated and is not easy to make samples that 
make the Monte Carlo converge...

Work inconcluded I still need to work on this project
